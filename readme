The program is divided into two different sides, the server side
and the client side. The server maintains a linked list data structure
of bank accounts. It starts off with a main thread
that spawns off two different threads, the periodic action cycle and
the session acceptor thread. The periodic action thread sleeps for
twenty seconds and then prints out all of the information held
by the data structure. The session acceptor thread opens a TCP
socket and waits for clients to attempt to connect to the socket.
When a connection attempt is made this thread spawns a client session
thread. The client session thread reads the buffer sent from the
client which contains the client's command request. It proccesses and
executes the request from the client. 

The client side has two threads as well. The first is main which attempts
to connect to the server. If it fails, it waits 3 seconds and attempts to
connect again. Once the connection is established the client may send
operation requests to the server over the TCP socket that they connected
to. The second thread is the read thread that simply reads the responses
that the bank returns after sending a request. This allows the client to
confirm that the bank has read the request correctly and the request has
either been applied or denied.
